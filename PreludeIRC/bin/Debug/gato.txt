User said (private|gato):	BORED
Prelude responded to (pm | gato):	 I reach my hand holding my drink back to set it on the end table even as I lean closer to gently place my mouth over yours in a peaceful, sensitive kiss. I lightly lick your lips, my eyes closed, and breathe into your mouth. "I didn't do anything, Lauren, I'm just showing you that you have more courage than you give yourself credit for..." I welcome your hand on my leg and soon cover it with my own to guide it up and down my thigh.

Prelude responded to (pm | gato):	 I start slipping my body closer to you, bringing your wet toes closer to my mouth and our hips closer together
